  High-Performance Computing refers to the spectrum of computational
  facilities that give more power than you can fit in a typical
  desktop machine. This hands-on workshop will cover the techniques you
  need to effectively make use of High-Performance Computing resources
  in your research, including the Unix shell, and interacting with the
  job scheduler used on HPC systems.
